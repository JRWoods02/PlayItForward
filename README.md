HackHer 2024 Project on "social good"

A platform that connects sports teams with local social causes, enabling teams to support community projects through volunteering, fundraising matches, or awareness campaigns.

This web application was developed using Flask, HTML, and Bootstrap CSS.
Developed by Joel Coghlin, Joel Gallagher, and Jesse Woods; 3 Queen's engineering students for their first ever hackothon. Inspiration stems from our childhood sports teams that were actively involved in the community. For example, organizing a canned food drive on Halloween to donate to our local food bank. This was only possible when exposed to the limitless opportunities to give back and help within our community. We hope to expose other youth athletes to these opportunities as well.
